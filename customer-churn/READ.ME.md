# Customer Churn Analysis
## Overview
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers at risk of leaving and understand the key factors driving churn.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Matplotlib / seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
  
## Models
- Ensemble Averaging
- Decision Tree

## Key Results
- Achieved ~77% recall on churned customers.
- Identified usage frequency and session duration as key predictors.

## Business Value
These models can help identify high-risk customers early, enabling targeted retention efforts.
