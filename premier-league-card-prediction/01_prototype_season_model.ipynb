    "# Football Card Predicter Model\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- This project builds a statistical model to predict the number of cards in Premier League matches (home, away, and total).\n",
    "- It combines team behavioural tendencies and referee tendencies, and models match card counts using a Poisson framework.\n",
    "- The model first estimates expected cards from the team matchup, then scales that expectation to the referee’s historical card level.\n",
    "- The long-term goal of the project is to develop a fully testable, walk-forward evaluated football card model using only information available before kick-off (no data leakage).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives \n",
    "\n",
    "- Build weighted team profiles from historical Premier League data.\n",
    "- Build weighted referee profiles from historical Premier League data.\n",
    "- Generate expected card counts for any fixture.\n",
    "- Convert expected values into probabilities using the Poisson distribution.\n",
    "- Combine team and referee models in a statistically coherent way.\n",
    "- Lay the foundation for match-level back-testing and evaluation.\n"

    "## Steps\n",
    "- Business/Project Understanding\n",
    "    - See Overview and Objectives sections above.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Understanding, Cleaning, and Preparation\n",
    "    - Referee Data\n",
    "        - Obtained referee season-level data from whoscored.com (Premier League, historical seasons).\n",
    "        - Data originally stored as one CSV per season. Combined into a single Excel workbook with one sheet per season.\n",
    "        - Initial cleaning performed using Power Query and Excel:\n",
    "            - Removed irrelevant columns.\n",
    "            - Corrected formatting issues.\n",
    "        - Removed four erroneous referee entries where averages were unrealistically high (20–27 yellows per game). These referees only had two appearances each and were clear data errors.\n",
    "        -  Cleaned referee name field and standardised into a unique referee_id to handle formatting inconsistencies and initials. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Team Data\n",
    "        - The model requires card data split by:\n",
    "            - home vs away\n",
    "            - cards for vs cards against\n",
    "        - Data obtained from thestatsdontlie.com (Premier League team statistics).\n",
    "        - Historical team data was only available as images and was converted into CSV format using AI-assisted extraction, then manually checked.\n",
    "        - One CSV per season combined into a single Excel workbook with separate sheets.\n",
    "        - Final dataset provides season-level averages of:\n",
    "            - home yellows / reds for and against\n",
    "            - away yellows / reds for and against\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Data Modelling\n",
    "    - Team Modelling\n",
    "        - Loaded all team sheets into pandas and concatenated into a single dataframe.\n",
    "        - Created standardised team_id keys to handle naming inconsistencies.\n",
    "        - Added a season column derived from sheet names.\n",
    "        - Implemented exponential decay weighting to prioritise recent seasons while retaining historical information. Originally this was a dictionary of hard-coded weights.\n",
    "        - Added season weights to the dataframe.\n",
    "        - Built weighted mean function (multiplies a series of team data (5 rows, one row for each season) by the corresponding weights). \n",
    "        - Grouped by team_id and calculated weighted averages for:\n",
    "            - home cards for\n",
    "            - home cards against\n",
    "            - away cards for\n",
    "            - away cards against\n",
    "        - Initially modelled yellows and reds separately, then combined into total card measures 8 columns -> 4 columns.\n",
    "        - Implemented a team lookup function to dynamically retrieve any team’s weighted profile.\n",
    "        - Constructed a function that outputs expected home, away, and total cards for any fixture based purely on team tendencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Referee Modelling\n",
    "        - Loaded all referee sheets and concatenated into a single dataframe.\n",
    "        - Standardised referee names into a unique referee_id to handle initials and formatting differences.\n",
    "        - Added season labels and dropped unnecessary columns.\n",
    "        - Applied the same exponential decay weighting approach used for teams.\n",
    "        - Implemented:\n",
    "            - Weighted referee averages (yellow, red, total cards per game).\n",
    "            - Appearance counter across seasons.\n",
    "        - Applied a minimum appearance threshold to flag unreliable referee estimates.\n",
    "        - Built a referee lookup function returning a referee’s weighted card profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Combining the Models\n",
    "        - The team model estimates match-specific distribution of cards.\n",
    "        - The referee model estimates the baseline match environment.\n",
    "        - The two are combined by scaling team-based expected values to the referee’s historical average:\n",
    "            - adjusted team λ = team λ × (ref λ / team total λ)\n",
    "        - Referees control overall match strictness\n",
    "        - Teams influence who receives cards\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Probabilistic Layer (Poisson Model)\n",
    "        - Implemented a Poisson PMF to calculate the probability of seeing exactly k cards.\n",
    "        - Built functions to compute:\n",
    "            - Full card count distributions.\n",
    "            - Over/under probabilities (e.g., over 3.5, 4.5, etc.).\n",
    "        - This converts point estimates into usable probability ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluation (planned)\n",
    "    - This version focuses on model construction only.\n",
    "    - Formal evaluation will be introduced in v2 using match-level data:\n",
    "        - Rolling training windows.\n",
    "        - Walk-forward testing.\n",
    "        - Prediction tracking.\n",
    "        - Calibration and stability analysis."
